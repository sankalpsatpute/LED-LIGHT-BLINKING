# LED-LIGHT-BLINKING
A beginner-friendly Arduino UNO project that blinks an LED at 1-second intervals.          
# Arduino LED Blinking Project

This project demonstrates how to blink an LED using an Arduino UNO. It is the most basic project for beginners to get started with Arduino.

##  Components Required

- Arduino UNO board  
- LED 
- 220Ω resistor 
- Breadboard and jumper wires 
- USB cable for programming  

##  Circuit Setup

### Using Onboard LED:
- The onboard LED is connected to digital pin 13.
- No external components are required.

### Using External LED:
- Connect the anode (+) of the LED to digital pin 13 through a 220Ω resistor.
- Connect the cathode (–) to GND on the Arduino.

##  Steps to Upload

1. Connect the Arduino UNO to your computer using a USB cable.
2. Open the Arduino IDE.
3. Select the correct board and port:
   - **Tools > Board > Arduino UNO**
   - **Tools > Port > Select the correct COM port**
4. Copy the blink code into the IDE.
5. Click **Upload**.

##  Output

- The onboard or external LED will start blinking with a 1-second interval.
